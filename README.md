# dragonclaw

## What is this sorcery? 

DragonClaw aims to answer to the tedious process of getting a usable reverse shell from the worst machine possible. 

This came up as a first idea of having to redo the same things over and over again (which is the definition of insanity). 

## When it will be available ? 

I'm currently working on it. I would suggest you come back in a few days.
